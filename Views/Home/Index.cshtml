                    We can only add a limited number of tours at this time. They will be removing the
                    visitors center soon so that they can complete the landscaping. When the trailer is
                    gone, we anticipate being able to talk to groups on the lawn of the church across the
                    street or at the Morgan's backyard. We are trying to facilitate as many groups as
                    possible, so please only sign-up when you can commit to coming on the selected date
                    and time. We have a lot of last minute cancelations.
